        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I am Ardit Koka, a PhD candidate. I am a PhD candidate with a strong research focus on Macroeconomics, Monetary Policy, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Banking, and Money. My work aims to contribute to the understanding of financial systems, the evolving role of central banks, and the implications of digital currency innovations in modern economies.

I hold a Master’s degree in International Economics and Commerce from Università Politecnica delle Marche, where I developed a deep understanding of global economic dynamics, trade policies, and financial markets. My academic background equips me with a strong analytical foundation to explore key economic issues related to monetary policy and banking stability.

My research interests include:

The effectiveness of monetary policy in different macroeconomic environments.

The impact of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial systems and traditional banking.

The role of banks and money in shaping economic growth and stability.

Macroeconomic models analyzing financial stability and economic fluctuations.

I am actively engaged in academic research and discussions on the future of monetary frameworks, contributing to conferences and policy debates. I aim to bridge the gap between economic theory and policy applications to enhance our understanding of financial stability and innovation in the monetary system.

For inquiries, collaborations, or discussions, feel free to reach out via email or connect on professional platforms.
